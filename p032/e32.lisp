;; The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
;; containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9
;; pandigital.

;; Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
;; identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
;;
;; HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
;; only include it once in your sum.
